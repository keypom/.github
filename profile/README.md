# Keypom: Your Gateway to Affordable and Customizable Onboarding on the Blockchain

Welcome to the Keypom organization on GitHub! Keypom is a public good smart contract that revolutionizes the way we onboard users onto the blockchain, offering a seamless, cost-effective, and highly customizable experience. 

## What is Keypom?

Keypom is an access key factory designed to address three common challenges prevalent in the blockchain ecosystem:

1. **Affordable Onboarding:** People desire a cost-effective, customizable, and unique onboarding experience for users.

2. **Enhanced Security:** Companies are cautious about exposing full access keys in their backend servers.

3. **Seamless User Experience:** Decentralized applications (dApps) aim for a frictionless user experience with zero barriers to entry onboarding.

The Keypom contract was initially created to overcome the 1 $NEAR minimum deposit requirement for creating linkdrops using the [regular linkdrop contract](https://github.com/near/near-linkdrop). By attaching a minimum of 1 $NEAR, this made the process costly and unscalable for projects looking to onboard users onto the NEAR blockchain. In contrast, Keypom has been meticulously optimized to minimize costs.

## Bridging the Gap in Blockchain Onboarding

Blockchain technology offers numerous advantages, including sovereign ownership, digital rights, privacy, freedom, and peer-to-peer coordination. However, these benefits are often out of reach for everyday individuals due to a high barrier to entry. The complexities of creating and funding a crypto wallet, coupled with technical jargon and unfamiliar processes, discourage many potential users. NEAR's powerful account model remains underutilized because of its complexity for developers. Keypom simplifies this with a single API call.

As NEAR aspires to onboard 1 billion users to Web3, there's an urgent need to overcome the high barriers developers face when building on NEAR and the challenges users encounter when adopting blockchain technology.

## Cost Comparison: Keypom vs. Traditional Linkdrop

Here's a cost comparison illustrating the significant cost savings Keypom offers for onboarding new users onto NEAR with a named account:

|                  | 1 Account        | 1,000 Accounts  | 1,000,000 Accounts |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Traditional Linkdrop | ~1 NEAR           | ~1,003 NEAR       | ~1,002,840 NEAR      |
| Keypom              | ~0.0035 NEAR  | ~3.5 NEAR            | ~3,500 NEAR              |
|                   | ~99.65% Cheaper | ~99.65% Cheaper | ~99.65% Cheaper      |

Keypom empowers anyone to create highly customizable onboarding experiences for their users, whether they are new or existing to the blockchain space. Users with existing wallets can also benefit from Keypom links to experience an app and then transfer assets later.

## Our Solution

Keypom enables the creation of highly customizable access keys, each acting like its own smart contract. These access keys are derived from "drops," which define their functionalities and behaviors. Drops can be seen as containers for access keys, and you can create multiple buckets, each with its set of keys. Each key operates in accordance with the drop it belongs to.

We're excited to have you explore Keypom and welcome your contributions to this open-source project.
